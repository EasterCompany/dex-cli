# dex-cli

Main application for managing local, cloud, development, and production services in the Dexter ecosystem. Linux (Arch/Debian/Ubuntu) support only.

## Installation

### Install Pre-built Binary (Recommended)

You can install `dex-cli` by downloading the pre-built binary and running the installation script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://easter.company/scripts/install_dex-cli.sh)"
```

This method is **recommended for most users** as it's faster and doesn't require a Go development environment.

### Install from Source (Advanced)

You can install `dex-cli` from source by running the following script:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://easter.company/scripts/install_from_source_dex-cli.sh)"
```

This method is **not recommended** for most users, _unless you intend of modifying and/or contributing to the dex-cli project_.
